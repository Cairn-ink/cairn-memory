# Product adapter: P2a, P2b and P2d

Select `profile:'context-read-product-v1.1'` and `version:'context-read-v1'`
with `openContextProductReader` from the core entry. P2a releases capabilities
and canonical exact evidence fetch for DELETE stores: Memories on physical
v18/v20–v33, Cards on v23–v33, and one namespace or personal plus one project.
P2b adds lexical candidates, representation-v2 assembly, index status and explicit
service maintenance on that same scope. Reader requests use certified product
indexes only. Semantic search remains unavailable; no provider is
constructed. P2d adds explicitly opted-in WAL handling, subject to deployment
qualification below. The legacy profile and sidecar remain unchanged.

The product authenticates and resolves ACLs before opening. It supplies:

- A process/service-owned `createContextReadSupervisor()` before any open.
- The canonical `path`, fixed `readSet` and complete `ownerCoverage` descriptor
  (`omittedNamespaces:0` for P2a/P2b).
- Trusted `requestControl:{requestId,handleId,credentialBindingId,
  credentialExpiresUtcMs,requestMaxMs}`. The three identifiers must be freshly
  minted unguessable ASCII strings of at most 64 bytes. Actual authenticated
  expiry is a UTC millisecond integer, or `null` for no independent expiry.
  Request duration is 1–5,000 ms. The parent stamps admission and converts
  expiry once; opening and every call consume this same window.
- One bounded opaque own-data credential, passed separately to each read/status call.
- A local-file `host:{moduleUrl,configuration}`. Its module exports
  `createContextReadHost(configuration)`, returning synchronous
  `authorize(request,credential)` and `isCurrent(grant,request)` functions.
  These functions run in the engine Worker. `isCurrent` returns literal `true`
  only when published credential-revocation/erasure state is current and any
  configured ownerGeneration still equals the issued value. Unknown,
  asynchronous or throwing checks fail closed. Authentication never runs here.
- An optional disconnect `AbortSignal` in the separate `{signal}` argument
  to opening and calls. `diagnostics:true` selects supervisor-only native
  telemetry. Opening `deadlineMs` defaults to 5,000; fetch defaults to 1,000.

The trusted configuration also supplies `requestReservation`, one fresh fixed
four-byte SharedArrayBuffer initialized to zero for this issuance. The parent
atomically consumes it once. Its backing storage must remain bound to these
request/handle/credential IDs in trusted issuance state; clones share it. Never
reset it or replace it to retry the same issuance. This prevents replay after
the bounded registry has forgotten completed IDs, including null-expiry
credentials. Missing/already consumed reservations refuse `authority_required`.

The engine's concrete trusted issuance handoff is
`configuration.requestBinding`:

```js
{
  kind: 'request', requestId, handleId, credentialBindingId,
  credentialExpiresUtcMs,
  credentialDigest, // base64url SHA-256 of canonical own-data credential JSON
  ownerId, namespaces: { readSet, ownerCoverage }, issuedAt,
  // ownerGeneration: positive safe integer, only when configured
}
```

Canonical credential JSON recursively sorts object keys by UTF-8 bytes and
preserves array order. `credentialDigest` is available internally from
`core/context-product-control.mjs` for adapter wiring. Keep this configuration,
the credential and requestControl out of model fields, public diagnostics and
logs. The parent checks issuance IDs, expiry, selected mapping and credential
digest before dispatch; it consumes the request/handle reservation once.
A `kind:'service'` issuance cannot open this reader. Service maintenance uses the separate issuance below.

`authorize` must verify its trusted issuance state, allowed method and **entire**
`request.input`, including fetch fences/deadline, before returning the exact
requestBinding as its method grant. The request also includes owner/namespaces,
the parent-stamped requestControl and credentialBindingId. Returning a snapshot
without verifying the complete operation binding is not a valid adapter.
Additional trusted configuration can carry bounded SharedArrayBuffers for
Worker-local publication checks. No raw bearer or function crosses IPC.

If bootstrap acquires outer resource attribution or independent child/provider
capacity, register its disposer **before acquisition** with the injected
`configuration.resourceOwner.register('lease'|'provider', disposer)`. This is
resource accounting, not an authority lease. Disposers must be idempotent and
resolve only after actual release. They run even when host construction throws;
unconfirmed release keeps a process-wide failed quarantine. Optional
`host.close()` is registered as outer attribution and runs on graceful shutdown. Native Worker termination alone
cannot release registered external attribution.

```js
const supervisor = createContextReadSupervisor(); // service-owned
let reader;
try {
  reader = await openContextProductReader({
    supervisor, path, version: 'context-read-v1',
    profile: 'context-read-product-v1.1', readSet, ownerCoverage,
    requestControl, host: { moduleUrl, configuration }, diagnostics: true
  }, { signal });
  const capabilities = await reader.getContextReadCapabilities();
  const evidence = await reader.fetchCandidateEvidence({
    readSet, refs, intent: 'current', deadlineMs: 1000
  }, requestCredential, { signal });
  // evidence is {ok:true,value:{items,snapshot}} or a sanitized error envelope.
} catch (error) {
  if (error.cleanupId) await supervisor.drain(error.cleanupId);
  throw error;
} finally {
  await reader?.close();
}
// On service shutdown, also covers constructors that returned no handle:
await supervisor.close();
```

Fetch accepts full refs with optional aligned internal fences, or a host-only
snapshot, under the existing mutual exclusions and exact evidence semantics.
Snapshots bind the product profile and stable owner generation rather than a
request credential; a fresh authenticated request may refetch them. Compact tool
refs must first be expanded against the product's immutable namespace mapping.

Every authority-bearing fetch takes one entry sample and one final sample
immediately before its authoritative canonical read. No authority callback
follows that read. A changed final sample returns bare `scope_changed`; a change
published later may still allow completion before the original cutoff. The
internal final-envelope guard also protects future data-bearing diagnostic
errors. Search and assembly diagnostic errors also take their final sample before
constructing a data-bearing error envelope. Status and maintenance take their
final sample immediately before a fresh canonical read transaction.

Opening operational failures reject with sanitized `code` and `cleanupId`;
validation errors create no Worker. Fetch/capabilities return Promise envelopes.
Timeout/cancellation settles independently of cleanup; late data is discarded.
Await close in the request's finally block and drain the supervisor on shutdown.
Do not treat timeout as proof of disposal or as fallback authority.

`getCleanupStatus(id)` returns the frozen contract metadata. `drain(id)` returns
that final metadata plus `diagnostics`; `drain()` snapshots cleanup records,
including completed operations, without stopping healthy handles. Concurrent
drains share one delivery promise. Record/export diagnostics promptly, then
`ackCleanup(id)` to release completed history. Unknown/expired IDs are
`invalid_input`, never evidence of zero native failures. Process-wide limits are
256 live records, 1,024 completed records, 1 MiB completed metadata, 16 MiB
completed diagnostics and a nonrenewing five-minute history lifetime. Pending
and failed safety records never expire. A new supervisor cannot bypass them.

Before erasure/restore, stop clients and new admissions, publish denial and drain
all owned resources. Restore invalidates old request bindings. The product owns
this integration and any separately reauthenticated fallback. Real +50 ms
settlement and deployment latency gates require the opt-in qualification runs;
ordinary tests use mock clocks and rendezvous.

## P2b service maintenance and prebuild

The product supplies independent authenticated service issuance in trusted
`host.configuration.serviceBinding`. It has this closed shape:

```js
{
  kind: 'service', serviceId, credentialBindingId,
  credentialExpiresUtcMs, credentialDigest,
  ownerId, namespaces: { readSet, ownerCoverage }, issuedAt,
  // ownerGeneration: positive safe integer, only when configured
}
```

Service IDs use the same 1–64 ASCII bounds as request IDs. Issuance time is a
nonnegative safe UTC millisecond integer; expiry is a nonnegative safe UTC
millisecond integer or null. The bounded opaque service credential is passed
separately to every maintenance/status call. The host validates it in its
Worker-local `authorize`, allowlists `refreshContextIndex` and
`getContextIndexStatus`, binds the whole input, and returns this exact binding.
Its synchronous `isCurrent` must consult service revocation/erasure state and
optional ownerGeneration. Setting a caller's `kind` cannot convert an HTTP
credential into service authority. Request credentials refuse at maintainer
construction and use, before index work.

```js
const maintainer = await openContextIndexMaintainer({
  supervisor, path: canonicalPath,
  version: 'context-read-v1', profile: 'context-read-product-v1.1',
  readSet, ownerCoverage, host: { moduleUrl, configuration },
  sidecarJournalMode: 'DELETE', diagnostics: true, deadlineMs: 5000
});
try {
  const result = await maintainer.refreshContextIndex({
    readSet, types: ['memory'], intent: 'current', mode: 'lexical',
    budget: { maxItems: 128, maxMs: 1000 }
  }, serviceCredential, { signal });
  const status = await maintainer.getContextIndexStatus({
    readSet, types: ['memory'], intent: 'current', deadlineMs: 1000
  }, serviceCredential, { signal });
} finally {
  await maintainer.close();
}
```

Each call receives a fresh parent-stamped service control window of at most
5,000 ms, shortened by that call's budget and authenticated service expiry.
Later quanta can use the still-valid service grant without borrowing or
extending an HTTP window. Opening has its own bounded supervised lifetime.
Use a service-owned supervisor before opening, await handle close, and close the
supervisor on shutdown, including failed constructor paths. Competing
maintainers for the same canonical identity and normalized selection refuse
`read_in_progress`; the reservation lasts through confirmed native disposal.
Coordinate maintenance across service processes through the product's service
ownership mechanism; one owned pump controls each active projection.

The canonical connection is read-only. Only the separate
`.context-read-product-v1.1.sqlite` cache is writable. Captured generations,
certificates and progress records use product-specific identities and HMAC
domains. Progress is a validated durable checkpoint, independent of whether a
Worker is alive. Fresh HTTP credentials with the same selected owner and
optional ownerGeneration reuse certificates. Issuance IDs and coverage selection
revision do not enter lexical statistics identity. A changed ownerGeneration
makes an old certificate access-stale for a newly valid credential.

`maxItems` is 1–1,024 transformation attempts and `maxMs` is 1–5,000 including
call overhead, scans, validation and publication. Batches contain at most 128
rows and 2,000,000 text units. Unchanged text is reused without tokenization;
metadata, support and verification work have separate internal accounting.
A successful quantum returns `{status,progress,coverage,channels}`. Only
`status:'complete'` certifies current readiness at its fresh post-commit
snapshot. `rebuilding` means unavailable, and a writer racing publication can
immediately make a valid captured certificate stale. Neither a durable commit
nor an earlier complete response authorizes a later search. `mode:'embeddings'`
performs no lexical build or inference and reports disabled semantic coverage.
`semantic:true` keeps the validated lexical result with a disabled semantic
channel; it cannot enable a provider. All these calls make zero provider calls.

Without `wal:true`, `sidecarJournalMode:'WAL'` still refuses `index_unavailable`
before opening. Default capabilities retain `journals:['DELETE']`,
`sidecarJournals:['DELETE']` and
`wal:{available:false,reason:'deferred_to_p2d'}` byte-for-byte.

### Explicit WAL deployment opt-in

The host sets **`wal:true` on both product reader and maintainer constructors**
to permit SQLite's coordinated WAL/SHM creation and read marks. It is a boolean
constructor option, separate from authentication and from the maintainer's
required `sidecarJournalMode:'DELETE'|'WAL'`. The opt-in supports all four
canonical/sidecar journal combinations, including read-only readers. Opted-in
capabilities advertise both journal lists as `['DELETE','WAL']` and
`wal:{available:true}`; this means code support, not platform qualification.
Omitting the option or setting false preserves P2b refusal and capabilities.
The legacy `openContextReader`/`context-read-v1` defaults do not accept this option.

```js
const reader = await openContextProductReader({ ...requestOptions, wal: true });
const maintainer = await openContextIndexMaintainer({
  ...serviceOptions, wal: true, sidecarJournalMode: 'WAL'
});
```

Use an owner-controlled **0700 directory**, with canonical, product sidecar,
lifecycle lock and every existing/created companion protected **0600**, regular,
owner-owned and single-linked. Directory, file and companion symlinks refuse.
The owner must allow SQLite to create WAL/SHM and read marks even for a read-only
handle. Metadata-only identity checks precede SQLite access and repeat at
statement boundaries. Concurrent external journal-mode changes or uncoordinated
file replacement are unsupported. A protected active DELETE journal retains zero wait. Canonical connections
are read-only and refuse a hot journal requiring recovery; only explicit
sidecar maintenance can recover its own rollback journal. Unsafe/unusable WAL arrangements report `index_unavailable`;
there is no writable-canonical fallback.

The maintainer establishes the configured mode only while initializing a new
staged sidecar under exclusive lifecycle exclusion. It never switches an
existing sidecar's mode; a configured-mode mismatch refuses. A damaged WAL
sidecar, or one whose mode cannot be established, also refuses the legacy
replacement protocol. Stop clients and maintenance, verify native drain, then
use the host's explicit cache-discard/rebuild procedure. Never manually remove
live WAL/SHM, force a checkpoint, restore SHM bytes or use immutable live reads.
No canonical journal-mode change or migration is performed by this API.

One Worker operation shares the existing topic policy across canonical and
sidecar connections: `min(operation deadline, operation start + 1000 ms) - 20 ms`.
Every prepare, cached step, iterator step and transaction boundary refreshes
the remaining floored native timeout; connection/transaction/statement admission
does not restart it. Detected DELETE uses zero wait. Detection uses SQLite's
zero-wait opening `PRAGMA journal_mode`, companion hints and at most one bounded
opening fallback when BUSY occurs without a rollback journal. An exclusive
DELETE connection before its first journaled write may receive that fallback;
a stale rollback journal may suppress a WAL opening wait. Neither transactions
nor traversals retry. Native exhaustion remains `storage_busy`; parent cutoff
remains `read_timeout`. Public cancellation does not await native reaping.

**Must qualify:** Linux ext4 on the production volume and deployed Node patch.
**Should qualify separately:** WSL2 ext4 and macOS APFS. Network filesystems are
outside deployment scope. Deterministic tests on development runtimes do not
qualify any of these platforms or establish zero-busy, latency, freshness,
availability or writer-progress measurement gates. The separate qualification
packet must combine P2a/P2b/P2c/P2d and retain complete native writer/reader drain.
**Production stays DELETE until the owner explicitly switches after the baseline
re-run and production-volume qualification.** Setting `wal:true` grants companion
access; it does not switch a live canonical database.

Before enabling search, explicitly complete both `current` and `history` for
every planned normalized projection. Physical v18/v20–v22 use
`types:['memory']`; a deliberate v23+ rollout prebuilds
`types:['memory','card']`. Other type combinations are separate projections.
Card requests on Memory-only layouts refuse instead of silently downgrading.
Unregistered combinations stay unavailable until explicitly maintained.

A reader can then use `findCandidates`, `contextRead`, or
`getContextIndexStatus` with its fresh request credential. The same host module
may supply `counter:{id,countTokens}` for assembly; counting runs in the Worker
and must satisfy the existing exact synchronous counter contract. Missing
counter refuses `token_count_unavailable`. Assembly uses the frozen
representation-v2 serializer, whole bodies, receipt rules, metering, and
canonical final refetch. Preserve the two host-only `_meta` values outside model
input. Fallback on `index_unavailable` is product-owned and must reauthenticate,
reauthorize and mark partial. Authority or lifecycle failures confer no fallback
authority.

## Cron renewal and supervised pump

`renewContextMaintenancePump` starts explicit service work only when called by
the product. Reader startup and lookup never start or renew it. Supply:

```js
const pump = renewContextMaintenancePump({
  supervisor, id: stablePumpId,
  window: {
    id: hostMinuteId, endsAtMonoMs, usedItems: persistedItems, usedMs: persistedMs
  },
  budgets: { maxItems: minuteItems, maxMs: minuteMs },
  quantum: { maxItems: quantumItems, maxMs: quantumMs },
  pollMs, renewalMs,
  projections: [{ options: maintainerOptions, types: ['memory'] }],
  serviceCredential
});
const status = pump.getStatus();
// The service owns/awaits this notification between cron invocations.
const terminalObservation = await pump.completion;
// On service shutdown, also await supervisor.close().
await pump.close();
```

The host chooses all quotas, renewal and selection metadata; the engine
supplies no assumed production budgets. `id` and window ID are nonempty strings
of at most 200 units. `endsAtMonoMs` is a safe integer in the process hrtime
millisecond domain, strictly future and no more than 60,000 ms away. Supply
nonnegative safe `usedItems`/`usedMs` from the host's cumulative ledger.
Per-window items are a positive safe integer, milliseconds are 1–60,000;
quantum bounds are 1–1,024 and 1–5,000. `pollMs` is 1–5,000 and `renewalMs` is
1–60,000. The full round-robin sweep must satisfy
`2 * activeSelections * max(pollMs, quantum.maxMs) <= 5000`; configurations
that cannot meet that observation cadence refuse before dispatch. Scheduling
and native overhead still require the deployment qualification. Freeze these
settings before qualification. Quanta reserve their full
item/time allowance before opening/dispatch, including unknown usage after
failure. This conservative accounting can exhaust a window before all reserved
work is used; counters never refund unknown work.

Each of 1–32 active selections supplies validated maintainer options with the
same supervisor and explicit physical types. Both intents are included
sequentially in round-robin order. Renewal with the same ID and selection
returns the same owned pump and handles, with no overlapping dispatch. It
extends supervision only, never the quota window or counters. A new window is
accepted only after the previous one ends. Restarting a handle/pump within a
window reuses process-owned store/owner/host-domain charges, even with a new pump ID; a different window ID cannot evade an
unexpired window. The product persists cumulative charges before process
replacement, maps new-process monotonic windows, and controls cross-process
ownership. HTTP credentials cannot open the pump.

Status exposes `active`, `budget_exhausted`, `renewal_expired`, `failed` or
`stopped`, along with cumulative reservations and a sanitized error code. The
completion promise reports exhaustion/renewal expiry or failure; the product
must observe the promise returned after each renewal, export cumulative
usage, and apply its configured reschedule/failure policy. Failure stops further
quanta and closes owned handles under supervision. Supervisor shutdown also
stops the timer and drains in-flight work and handles. No detached OS task or
log provides this ownership. The product must supply a service lifetime that
survives HTTP cron completion; if its host cannot do so, run the pump in an
explicitly owned maintenance service. No freshness or availability gate has
been measured by this package.

## Backup and restore

Back up canonical storage using the product's SQLite-consistent procedure or a
closed, quiescent database. Omit the derived product sidecar. A diagnostic
sidecar archive is non-restorable cache evidence.

For restore, close admissions, stop clients, revoke old request bindings and
drain reader/maintainer/pump supervisors. Validate the restored canonical
physical layout, schema, identity and logical content without migration.
Discard any copied product sidecar and its certificates before rebuilding;
never restore publication pointers in place, including a restore onto an
existing inode. Reopen maintenance with independent current service authority,
then complete all configured current/history projections before search
exposure. Copied canonical or sidecar file identities fail certificate
validation; explicit maintenance rebuilds rather than relabeling copied
certificates. Keep optional ownerGeneration in current host state.

Record the contract's separate backup, canonical verification, sidecar rebuild,
deep verification and fresh-reader verification times and disk sizes during
qualification. These are report-only outputs, with no invented time gate.
